## Introduction
Managing customers and orders is a fundamental aspect of many businesses. This project aims to provide a simple yet efficient system for handling customer and order data through a REST API. It ensures secure authentication and authorization using OpenID Connect and sends SMS alerts to customers upon order creation.

## Features
- REST APIs for managing customers and orders
- Authentication and authorization via OpenID Connect
- Integration with Twilio's Talking SMS gateway for sending SMS alerts to customers
- Secure handling of sensitive data
- Unit tests with coverage checking
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) setup

## Technologies Used
- Python Django: Backend framework for building web applications
- PostgreSQL: Relational database for storing customer and order data
- CircleCI: CI/CD platform for automating build, test, and deployment processes
- Twilip: SMS gateway for sending SMS alerts
- OpenID Connect: Authentication and authorization protocol
- Docker: Containerization technology for packaging the application
- Kubernetes: Container orchestration tool for managing containerized applications

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd savannah_api
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Configure environment variables:
   ```
   # Rename .env.example to .env and update with your configurations
   mv .env.example .env
   ```
5. Run migrations:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
6. Start the development server:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Usage
- To generate a token for authentication using OpenID Connect, follow these steps:
  1. Navigate to the project directory and locate the `google.html` file.
  2. Host the `google.html` file on a local server. You can use tools like Python's `http.server` module or any other web server of your choice.
     ```
     cd path/to/project
     python -m http.server 5500
     ```
  3. Open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:5500/google.html`.
  4. Follow the instructions on the page to sign in with your Google account and generate a token.
  5. Copy the generated token and use it for authentication in the API requests.

## Testing
Run unit tests with coverage checking:
```

coverage python manage.py test

```

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
This project is integrated with CircleCI for CI/CD. Upon pushing changes to the repository, CircleCI automatically triggers the build, runs tests, and deploys to the rendering platform.
